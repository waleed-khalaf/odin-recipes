    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Breakfast cereal is a quick and easy morning meal, typically made from
      processed grains that are often toasted or puffed, and served cold with
      milk. It can be sweetened, flavored, or enriched with vitamins, and is
      available in a wide variety of textures and tastesâ€”from crunchy flakes to
      chewy granola.
